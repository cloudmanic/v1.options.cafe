Dear Stockpeer Fans,
Say hello to Options Cafe. As the Founder and CEO of Stockpeer, and a tenured software developer, I am excited to announce the Stockpeer blog is retiring and Options Cafe trading software company is taking over.
For the last several months the Options Cafe Team has been tucked away working on something special. This is the same options trading software I've been using for my personal trading for the last 6 years rebuilt to serve the masses.

Graduating From Blog To Software Company

Options Cafe decided to take an entirely different approach: to excel in one area of trading—options only.We combine your multi-leg options into one trade strategy, making it easier to manage and monitor,Input your strategies and goals into our options trading software, and options that fit your criteria will populate.Advanced backtesting tool with in-depth performance reports.And much more!
Options Cafe will not be a broker; we communicate with brokers on your behalf. We plan to launch with Tradier (one of our favorite brokers for options trading). Our soft launch is targeted for late 2017, with the the aim to add additional brokers shortly thereafter.
By reading this e-mail, it means you are already on our mailing list. So, you will be the first to know when our trading software is released.
We hope you are as excited as we are for our transition from trading blog to options trading software. We can’t wait to share Options Cafe with everyone. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask!
Keep Trading,
~Spicer
