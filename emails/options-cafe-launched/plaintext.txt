Howdy,

I have some big news!! We have officially launched Options Cafe. You can now use our platform to make options trades via Tradier. No other trading platform allows you to discover, trade, and review your trades like Options Cafe. We have built Options Cafe from the ground up with one thing in mind — making multi-leg options trading a snap. I think we have built the options platform you have been yearning for.

Before going any further I thought I would lead with some very exciting news. As part of our launch, we have partnered with Tradier to provide brokerage services. With this partnership, we are able to provide commission-free stock and options trades included in your subscription to Options Cafe. For $60 a month or $600 a year, you can trade as much as you want and never pay a dime in commissions. Our service pays for itself in just a few trades.

An options trader with a small $20,000 account might trade 20 iron condor trades a month. So that would be 10 open trades and 10 closing trades for a total of 20 trades. At your current broker, you most likely are paying over $700 a month or $8,000 a year, just in commissions. With Options Cafe, you would only pay $60 / month or $600 / year.

Our partnership with Tradier is for new and current Tradier customers. Once you have created your Options Cafe account and linked your Tradier account, please contact us via help@options.cafe and we will setup your new pricing.

The launch of Options Cafe has been something we have been working on for years now. We originally created Options Cafe for our own internal use but realized it was too good not to share with the world. We have been using our platform to make our own trades for years now. With that said, we have existed on our own internal feedback. If we want to make Options Cafe increasingly better, we need your help.

Please, at any time send us your thoughts or issues to help@options.cafe. We promise to move quickly on any issues you might have and will consider deeply any suggestions.

Lastly, if you are new to options trading and just want to get some help, please email me at ask@options.cafe. I am more than happy to give you any advice I can provide. You can follow along with my SPY, put credit spread trading strategy via #SpicersTrades, or my monthly summaries on this blog.

I hope you love Options Cafe as much as we do.

Happy Trading!
~Spicer
