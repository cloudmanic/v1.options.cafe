## Cron - About 

Cron is designed to be a standalone app. It runs on its own and does utility activities such as downloading and storing data. This shares a code base with the core app so libraries can be shared.

Note: This is not run from typical unix cron. It has its own scheduling built in. Just run the app and leave it running.

The ```.env``` file is shared with the core application.

This app should be run from docker like all our other apps.
